'Truth' is a Discord bot that displays the national days and will soon display the national months.

**Why did I make this?**
Have you ever been minding your own business throughout the day and learned it's National Donut Day. Then you wonder, how are people knowing this type of thing or how can I keep up with the national days? Well here is the answer...

**Add to Server**
- Click the following link: **INSERT LINK HERE**
- Follow instructions in that link

**Server Setup**
- Truth's prefix is the '$' character
- Use the $setchannel command to give Truth a target automated messaging channel for your server (Automated messages will **NOT** work if this command is not executed)
- Use the $displayday command to show the current national days in the server's display channel
- Use the $displaymonth command to show the current national months in the server's display channel

**How Automation Works**
- The national days/months I am using are pulled from "https://nationaldaycalendar.com/"
- National Days are be displayed every day at 12:01 AM CST
- National Months will soon be displayed on the first of every month at 12:01 AM CST
