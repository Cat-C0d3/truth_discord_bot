'Truth' is going to be a Discord bot that displays the national days for the current day in a Discord channel.

Process:
 - Run Python script to create json file "holidays.json" full of national holidays for each month
 - Start Discord Bot up
 - Run the $setchannel command in Discord to set the only output channel for the discord bot
 - Now people can use the $display command on that server to see the current national days

Truth now is scheduled to display the national days every morning at 00:01:00.

Currently in progress... May take longer than usual because of work, school, and/or personal life stuff.
